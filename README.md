# ZYNQ-7000-ML-model-deployment-ZYBO
Methodology to built ML model using dataset for deploying on FPGA
-- This folder contains two datasets to .elf examples 
  - flower classification
  - eye dectection and -- eye dtc
  
 For this we need to download Xilinx_DNNDK3.1 - https://www.xilinx.com/products/design-tools/ai-inference/ai-developer-hub.html#edge 
  We need to paste models in xilinx dnndk and run dnnc for output in .elf
